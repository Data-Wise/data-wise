## Overview

My research focuses on developing statistical methodology for **causal inference**, with particular emphasis on **mediation analysis** — understanding the mechanisms through which interventions and exposures affect outcomes.

## Research Areas

### Causal Mediation Analysis

Developing methods to decompose total effects into natural direct and indirect effects, addressing:

- Identification under various assumptions
- Sensitivity to unmeasured confounding
- Multiple mediators and complex pathways
- Time-varying treatments and mediators

### Effect Size Measures

Novel effect size measures for mediation, including:

- **P_med** — Probability-based mediation measure
- **Proportion mediated** — Traditional and improved versions
- **E-values** — Sensitivity analysis metrics

### Statistical Computing

Translating methodology into accessible software:

- R packages for the mediationverse ecosystem
- Computational methods for confidence intervals
- Simulation tools for power analysis

## Collaborations

I collaborate with researchers in:

- Psychology and behavioral sciences
- Public health and epidemiology
- Educational research
- Clinical medicine
