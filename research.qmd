## Overview

My research focuses on developing and evaluating statistical methodologies that enhance the **robustness of statistical inferences** across various analytical domains. I am particularly committed to amplifying the **replicability of statistical methods** in educational, health, and prevention science.

## Methodological Research

### Causal Inference & Mediation Analysis

Developing methods for understanding causal mechanisms using:

- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** for causal mediation analysis
- **Natural direct and indirect effects** decomposition
- **Sensitivity analysis** for unmeasured confounding
- **Sequential mediation** with multiple mediators

### Statistical & Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis

Methods to assess robustness of findings:

- Sensitivity to violations of causal assumptions
- Monte Carlo approaches for complex models
- E-values and other sensitivity metrics

### Advanced Statistical Modeling

- **Generalized linear mixed-effects models**
- **Multivariate statistics**
- **Categorical data analysis**
- Judicious application of **machine learning** to health data

## Applied Research

### Drug Delivery Optimization

Collaborating on research to optimize drug delivery formulations with implications for:

- **Cancer research**
- **COVID-19 therapeutics**
- Pharmaceutical development

### Prevention Science

Working to improve statistical methods in:

- Educational interventions
- Health behavior change
- Public health programs

## Funding

Research supported by:

- **NASA** — National Aeronautics and Space Administration
- **NSF** — National Science Foundation  
- **NIH** — National Institutes of Health

## Collaborations

I work with researchers across disciplines including:

- Psychology and behavioral sciences
- Public health and epidemiology
- Pharmaceutical sciences
- Educational research
